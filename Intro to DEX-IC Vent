DEXIC Vent - Emergency Lung Ventilator

The need for development of DEXIC Vent rised at the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak. Recent situation in Italy, when doctors have been forced to decide which patient will be connected to lung ventilator and which not, we just confirmed there need to be as many emergency lugn ventilators designs as possible. 

DEXIC Vent addresses current supply shortage of many special parts. We aim to provide a design of ventilator build from at least 85% of components available in 3D printers. In others words: i) print parts on your 3D printer; 2) disassemble 3D printer; 3) create emergency ventilator and save the lives; 4) when the emergency is over, construct your 3D printer back.
